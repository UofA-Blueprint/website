            <h3>Do I need experience to apply?</h3>
            <p>
              Technical experience is not a requirement! We look for passion and
              drive above all, as we will help support our members to grow and
              learn about our tools.

            <h3>How much of a time commitment is Blueprint?</h3>
            <p>
              We expect about 10-12 hours out of our members per week. This will
              be split between worksessions, team bonding, and individual time
              spent on a project.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How are the project teams structured?</h3>
            <p>
              Project teams typically consist of 1 project lead, 4-6 developers,
              and 1-2 designers. Our projects are developed and designed over
              Fall - Spring every year.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I get to choose the team that I am on?</h3>
            <p>
              When you join Blueprint, we will have a period for project leads
              to present their projects to the rest of Blueprint. You may then
              fill out an interest form and we will put people onto teams of
              their choice.
